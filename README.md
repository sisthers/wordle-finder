# wordle-finder
Console application for finding correct answers in wordle, written on C#.
I made it for myself, so I could win when I get stuck.
It is not a well-written programm, but you can still use it to win games.
Perhaps someday I will rewrite it in Python or C++ and make an interface.

## Usage
### Download:
```
git clone https://github.com/sisthers/wordle-finder.git
